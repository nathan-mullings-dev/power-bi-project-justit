## ✅ Project Summary

The Power BI Sales Dashboard delivers actionable insights through four core visuals:

### 1. Total Sales by Category
A stacked bar chart displays sales across:
- **Technology**
- **Office Supplies**
- **Furniture**  
Segmented by: *Consumer*, *Corporate*, and *Home Office*  
> This reveals how different market segments contribute to category-level sales.

### 2. Profit by Country
A color-coded map shows profit levels by country across Europe.  
> Countries like **France**, **Germany**, and the **UK** stand out with strong profit margins.

### 3. Sales and Profit over Time
A dual-line chart illustrates trends from **2011 to 2014**:
- **Sum of Sales** vs **Sum of Profit**  
> Reveals a consistent year-over-year growth pattern.

### 4. Total Sales and Profit by Region
Bar charts compare performance in:
- **Central** (Top performer: 1.32M in sales)
- **South**
- **North**  
> Central region is a standout market with high sales and profit margins.
